Changes in cnaOpt 0.5.0 (2021-12-17)
	* selectMax(): Improved handling of multiple optima - as a consequence, the function multipleMax() and the argument allConCov in conCovOpt() are now obsolete (but kept for backward compatibility).
	* New argument warn in selectMax().
	* New argument maxCombs in ereduce() and DNFbuild().
	* New default reduce="ereduce" instead of reduce="rreduce" in DNFbuild().
	* ereduce(): Improved computational efficiency.
	* conCovOpt(): Reduced memory consumption.

Changes in cnaOpt 0.4.0 (2021-07-08)
	* cnaOpt(), conCovOpt() and other functions: Type of data is now identified automatically, according to the amendment introduced in package cna's version 3.2.0.
	* New arguments in cnaOpt(): reduce, niter, approx, maxCombs.
	* conCovOpt() and findOutcomes() have new arguments rm.dup.factors and rm.const.factors.
	* Some computational improvements and bug fixes.

Changes in cnaOpt 0.3.0 (2021-05-31, not submitted to CRAN)
	* rreduce() is now imported from package cna.

Changes in cnaOpt 0.2.0 (2020-09-14)
